My first project done in C in december 2018, before entering college. (I barely knew how to use C syntax at that time, just know how if and switch works).

It was the final project of the microcontroller discipline, given in the last year of the electrotechnics course at IFG. 

Very simple code, using switch case and serial. Anyway, it was really fun to create something functional and see the cart and everything else working.
